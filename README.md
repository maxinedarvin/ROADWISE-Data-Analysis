# ROADWISE Data Analysis

My dataset is the government's Data for Road Incident Visualization, Evaluation, and Reporting System (DRIVERS), an open source initiative by the World Bank. I used my data analyses to present for ROADWISE: The Road Safe Systems Challenge â€” an open call for students and professionals to design safer mobility systems using the Safe Systems Approach last June 14 2025.
